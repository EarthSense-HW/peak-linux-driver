Description: PEAK-System CAN-bus driver for kernel _KVERS_ (binary module)
 This package contains the set of loadable driver modules for the

 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own peak-linux-driver-modules. The peak-linux-driver-source package 
 has been provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or 
 kernel-package utilities to produce a version of peak-linux-driver-modules 
 for your kernel.
