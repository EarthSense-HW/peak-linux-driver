Description: PEAK-System CAN-bus driver for kernel _KVERS_ (binary module)
 This package contains the set of loadable driver modules for the
 Controller Area Network interface adapters from PEAK-System for kernel 
 version _KVERS_.
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own peak-linux-driver-modules. The peak-linux-driver-source package 
 has been provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or 
 kernel-package utilities to produce a version of peak-linux-driver-modules 
 for your kernel.
